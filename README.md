# Data Science Virtual Work Experience - British Airways with Forage

This repository contains my completed projects as part of the Data Science Virtual Internship program offered by Forage in collaboration with British Airways.

## Overview

The virtual Work Experience program consists of two main tasks:

### Task 1 - Web Scraping to Gain Company Insights

Customers who book a flight with British Airways will have multiple touchpoints with the brand. Understanding their feedback, needs, and sentiments is crucial for any business, including British Airways.

For the first task, I focused on web scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviews from a third-party source. The data collected was then analyzed to uncover valuable insights that could be useful for the company.

Customer review data for British Airways was scraped from Skytrax.

**Insights:**

A summary of the insights uncovered during the analysis is presented in the following slide:

### Task 2 - Predicting Customer Buying Behaviour

In the modern era, customers are well-informed due to easy access to information. This has drastically changed the buying cycle. Airlines, including British Airways, need to be proactive in acquiring customers before they even begin their travel journey.

The second task involved building a high-quality predictive model to forecast successful flight bookings using historical customer booking data.
